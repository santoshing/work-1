                                   A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat,
                                   placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves
                                   as a container or wrapper for another food type.[1][2][3] The sandwich began as a
                                   portable, convenient finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become
                                   prevalent worldwide.

                                   In the 21st century there has been considerable debate over the precise definition of
                                   sandwich, and specifically whether a hot dog or open sandwich can be categorized as
                                   such. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug
                                   Administration are the responsible agencies. The USDA uses the definition, "at least
                                   35% cooked meat and no more than 50% bread" for closed sandwiches, and "at least 50%
                                   cooked meat" for open sandwiches.[4] In Britain, the British Sandwich Association
                                   defines a sandwich as "any form of bread with a filling, generally assembled cold", a
                                   definition which includes wraps and bagels, but excludes dishes assembled and served
                                   hot, such as burgers.[5]
